## INF 465: Senior Capstone in Informatics

Students create teams, each representing their specialization, to solve 
a current technology challenge. The purpose of this course is for 
students from all the different Informatics tracks to come together and
work on a real world Informatics related problem. This course will 
require completion of 100 hours in a field placement. During their 
field placement students will work as part of a team comprised of their 
peers from other In- formatics tracks to complete a capstone project. 
The project itself will be dictated by the individual needs of the 
placement and the strengths of the team. The Instructor of I INF 465 
will act as a mentor to the student teams and help to guide them 
through their projects. May be repeated for credit up to a total of 6 
credits with permission of department. Pre-requisite(s): Informatics 
seniors only and instructor permission.

## Capstone Project: Listening Here

You will work in teams on the development of Listening Here, a 
geo-located mobile web app for creative and mindful listening 
(http://listeninghere.org). Some of the projects your team might 
be working on include: programming, web development, tutorial 
creation, database usage, graphic design, and testing. Each student 
whose work is integrated into the live app will be credited and will 
be able to include this experience on their CV.

You are expected to use your available resources (your expertise, your 
colleaguesâ€™ expertise, your problem-solving skills, your research 
skills, etc.) to solve the technical problems you are assigned. Push 
yourself, but know your limits. If you find you have hit too many dead 
ends, consult the instructor.

 * **syllabusINF465s2019.pdf** is the syllabus. Read it. You 
know how they say there is no such thing as a bad question? They're 
wrong. A bad question is when you ask a question and the answer was in 
the syllabus all along. If you have a question, make sure it hasn't 
already been answered. If you ask a question to clarify something 
specific that you found confusing *after* reading the syllabus, that 
is appropriate and encouraged.
